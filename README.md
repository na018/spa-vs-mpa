## ABstract
Performance is one of the key indicators for users declaring a web application as
comfortable to use or not. Sadly in a lot of cases performance is only spent little
attention to. The main focus is still on the functionality of the application. How-
ever performance today is really important since more and more web applications
are visited by mobile gadgets, which often struggle with slow network connections.
Furthermore mobile contracts make their users pay for the transmitted kilobytes
over the network. 
This Github Repo represents the code of the four applications, which habe been developed for investigating two architectural styles
of developing web applications: single page- and multi page applications.
This study project tries to list the diferences from origination, architecture, network payload and
transmission.
